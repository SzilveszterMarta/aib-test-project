# MCOM Technical Test

Please note this is the progress I made in two hours, there are several areas left for further improvements.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Instructions to run the application

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install` and `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

## Areas to improve

Adding more styles to improve the look of the application, using SCSS instead of plain css.

Adding a loading screen while we are waiting for the API response.

Covering the logic with unit test.
